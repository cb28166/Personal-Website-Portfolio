                        <p>An in progress App where users can look up alcoholic recipes based off of ingredients they own. Users can also look up recipes as well if they wish.</p>
                        <!--HIDDEN TEXT-->
                        <p class="long-description">In more detail: users can select amongst a list of ingredients that they already posses and then the app provides recipes based off of the inputted ingredients.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">So for example, a user can select amongst different mixers they have and then select margaritas, then the app presents various margarita recipes that include the ingredients selected they have.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">In addition, users can simply look up recipes they want if they already know what they want to make.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">Finally, users can save recipes and share these favorite recipes with other users to promote a social aspect fo the app. Other features are to be introduced later.</p>

                        <p>This is a simple data visualization webpage designed for the restaurant I worked in. Here it displayed the restaurant's alcohol inventory in a visual and efficient way for our managers to easily understand</p>
                        <!--HIDDEN TEXT-->
                        <p class="long-description">In more detail: the web application displays the alcoholic inventory of the restaurant using tables and bar graphs. This is to help managers visualize and better understand what inventory they actually have.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">For example, by clicking on the tequilla bottle section, it would display a simple table which shows the name of the product, type of product, and the amount currently in storage. Alongside that, a simple bar graph displays the amount of each of that type of ingredient currently owned.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">In addition, users can simply look up recipes they want if they already know what they want to make.</p>
                        <p class="long-description">Finally, users can simply add or subtract using buttons or simply input new amounts if the amount changes of that product.</p>
